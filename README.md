The final project for group 27, consisting of:

Emelia Johansson, Martin Lindberg, Celina Zander and Elias Ã…kerlund.

# TO-DO LIST (so we remember what to do)

Fix styling on the house boxes for the sorting, use grid or flex to place them nicely, color the box to match the house

Fix link from sorting to spells and people

Handle fetched API info correctly

Design a page for looking up spells and people


# Project description

Our project is an application meant to help new students at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. A new student can use the page to look through what spells they will learn, as well as look up information about other students at Hogwarts.

This far into the project we have implemented:

A front page

.

We still want to add the following features:

A small sorting ceremony to give the user a house, either randomly or by choice

A way for the user to view all the spells provided by the API

A way for the user to view all the characters and members of different houses

A way for the user to change house

A way for the user to add their own spells, or add descriptions to spells that they've learned
  
.

Given that we have time, here are some more features we would like to add:

Save favorite spells

Add a small icon in the upper corner to show what house the user belongs to
