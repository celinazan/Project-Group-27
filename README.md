# Project of Group 27

The final project for group 27, consisting of:

Emelia Johansson, Martin Lindberg, Celina Zander and Elias Ã…kerlund.


# Project description

(OBS that we had to/decided to change from our original project, since our first choice didn't have a working API)

Our project is an application called "Hogwarts Study Tool", an app meant to help new students at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry with learning spells and keeping notes of what the spells do. A new student can use the page to look through what spells they will learn, as well as look up information about other students in their house as well as teachers from the four house at Hogwarts.

This far into the project we have implemented:

A front page

A small sorting ceremony to give the user a house, either randomly or by choice

A page showing a list of members of the users house when they are sorted

A way for the user to change house

A way for the user to view all the spells provided by the API

A way for the user to view all the characters and members of the different houses

.

We still want to add the following features:


A way for the user to add descriptions to spells that they've learned

A way for the user to view characters outside of the houses (ministry workers and death eaters)
  
.

Given that we have time, here are some more features we would like to add:

Be able to save favorite spells

Add a small icon in the upper corner to show what house the user belongs to

Add the house crest to the sorted page to match the house
   
  
# File descriptions

# TO-DO LIST (so we remember what to do)

Next button on the Spell Details doesn't work

Fix so that spells that are favorited are marked somehow
