# Project of Group 27

The final project for group 27, consisting of:

Emelia Johansson, Martin Lindberg, Celina Zander and Elias Ã…kerlund.


# Project description

Our project is an application meant to help new students at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. A new student can use the page to look through what spells they will learn, as well as look up information about other students in their house as well as teachers from their house at Hogwarts. To view other students, the user must change house.

This far into the project we have implemented:

A front page

A small sorting ceremony to give the user a house, either randomly or by choice

A way for the user to change house

.

We still want to add the following features:


A way for the user to view all the spells provided by the API

A way for the user to view all the characters and members of their house

A way for the user to add descriptions to spells that they've learned
  
.

Given that we have time, here are some more features we would like to add:

Save favorite spells

Add a small icon in the upper corner to show what house the user belongs to
   
  
# File descriptions

Welcome.js - Code for the first welcome page

Sorting.js - Code for the sorting process

Sorted.js - Code for showing the chosen house and saving that information for the user

Home.js - Navigation page for reaching different function

Spells.js - Fetching all the spells from the API

Characters.js - Code to be able to view the members of the different houses


# TO-DO LIST (so we remember what to do)

Handle fetched API info correctly, fix the page importing the spells because background is off and its just a long list

Design a page for looking up spells and people

Design a page for adding info to spells the user has learned

Make a function to randomize house, exists in the API! 

Figure out how to make a unique background for the spells and people pages

Place the spells, learned spells etc cards in a square like in the sketch 

Make the spells, learned spells etc cards not clickable on entire screen, limit their width
