# Project of Group 27

The final project for group 27, consisting of:

Emelia Johansson, Martin Lindberg, Celina Zander and Elias Ã…kerlund.


# Project description

Our project is an application for finding, and hopefully enjoying, jokes in different categories that we fetch with calls to a selection of joke based APIs. The basic idea is that you get to choose a category, such as "dad jokes" or "Chuck Norris jokes", from which you want to view a joke. 

This far into the project we have implemented:


We still want to add the following features:

. A way to pick what category of jokes the user wants to view

. A way to save favorite jokes

. A function to get a joke randomly from any category

. A sidebar to easily switch between category of jokes

. A reload button so you can generate a new joke without having to manually refresh the page


Given that we have time, here are some more features we would like to add:

. A joke of the day, displayed at the top of the page

. Depending on API info, make a way to search for jokes

. Also depending on API info, maybe have category choices within categories
