# Project of Group 27

The final project for group 27, consisting of:

Emelia Johansson, Martin Lindberg, Celina Zander and Elias Ã…kerlund.


# Project description

Our project is an application meant to help new students at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. A new student can use the page to look through what spells they will learn, as well as look up information about other students at Hogwarts.

This far into the project we have implemented:

A front page

.

We still want to add the following features:

A small sorting ceremony to give the user a house, either randomly or by choice

A way for the user to view all the spells provided by the API

A way for the user to view all the characters and members of different houses

A way for the user to change house

A way for the user to add their own spells, or add descriptions to spells that they've learned
  
.

Given that we have time, here are some more features we would like to add:

Save favorite spells

Add a small icon in the upper corner to show what house the user belongs to
   
  
# File descriptions

Welcome.js - Code for the first welcome page

App.js - 


# TO-DO LIST (so we remember what to do)

Fix the width of clickable area for the house cards

Handle fetched API info correctly, fix the page importing the spells because background is off and its just a long list

Design a page for looking up spells and people

Design a page for adding info to spells the user has learned

Fix so that users chosen house is saved

Make a function to randomize house, exists in the API!
